Dunton Hot Springs is a small and exclusive resort nestled deep in the San Juan Mountains of the Colorado Rockies. This perfectly restored ghost town thrives on contradictions; hand-hewn log cabins exquisitely furnished, a life-worn saloon serving food of startling quality, lung torturing trails followed by pampering massages, sensuous hot springs beneath shimmering snow banks. Free of cell phones, this romantic old mining town still provides high speed wireless internet access in every cabin and video conferencing in our dance hall to the comforting sound of a tumbling waterfall|37.7729368|-108.0940133|Dunton Hot Springs|http://duntonhotsprings.com/|
